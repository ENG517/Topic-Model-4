  <title>About the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) Score</title>
  <shortdesc>
    The Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) plays an important role in breeding horses because the BLUP values of the parent horses impact a foal's genetic potential and innate skills.

      <title>What is BLUP?</title>
      <p>
        BLUP is a genetic index for horses. BLUP values for all horses fall within a range between -100 and 100, with -100 being the lowest possible BLUP and 100 being the highest possible BLUP.
      </p>
      <p>
        A higher average BLUP of the parents will increase a foal's chance of having higher genetic potential and innate skills. The foal will not have any innate skills if the average BLUP of the parents is below 0.

      <title>What factors influence a horse's BLUP score?</title>
      <p>
        The following factors influence a horse's BLUP:
        <ul>
          <li>Training level in the best three skills for its breed</li>
          <li>Number of competitions won</li>
          <li>Horse's age</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To reach a score of 100 BLUP, a horse must fully maximize training in the top three skills for its breed, win 20 competitions, and be at least 10 years of age.
