  What an affix can do:
  Help a farm make a name for itself and improve it's reputation
You can register an affix and add it to the name of the horses that you have produced.
You can create an extra affix every 30 days of seniority. 
You will also get more affixes by subscribing to a Pegasus account.
You can have several affixes and give them based on the breeds you use, for instance, or in order to differentiate lineages within a specific breeding farm focused on this or that breed.
