  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">
    The Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) plays an important role in breeding horses because the BLUP values of the parent horses impact a foal's genetic potential and innate skills.
  </p>
    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What is BLUP?</h2>
      
      <p class="p">
        BLUP is a genetic index for horses. BLUP values for all horses fall within a range between -100 and 100, with -100 being the lowest possible BLUP and 100 being the highest possible BLUP that a horse can reach.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        A higher average BLUP of the parents will increase a foal's chance of having higher genetic potential and innate skills. The foal will not have any innate skills if the average BLUP of the parents is below 0.

    <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">What factors influence a horse's BLUP score?</h2>
      
      <div class="p">
        The following factors influence a horse's BLUP:
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="li">Training level in the best three skills for its breed</li>
          <li class="li">Number of competitions it has won</li>
          <li class="li">Horse's age</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="p">
        To reach a score of 100 BLUP, a horse must fully maximize training in the top three skills for its breed, win 20 competitions, and be at least 10 years of age.
