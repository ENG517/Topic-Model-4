## User Scenario 1: Affixes
Map Outline:
- c_about_affix.dita (About Affixes)
- c_team_affixes.dita (Team Affixes)
- t_reserve_affix.dita (Reserve an Affix)
  - t_apply_affix.dita (Apply an Affix)

This map responds to Tina’s goal to learn the essentials of the game Howrse by layering the key elements of an affix. She notices the italicized indicators for affixes, but has no knowledge of them yet. C_about_affixes provides Tina with an understanding of what an affix is. Then, c_team_affixes explains what she would need to know about affixes for team versions. After Tina learns what an affix is, she is ready to reserve an affix using the task topic t_reserve_affix. When Tina has reserved an affix, she can then apply it by following t_apply_affix.

## User Scenario 2: Coverings
Map Outline:
- c_about_coverings.dita (About Coverings)
- c_team_coverings.dita (About Team Coverings)
  - c_team_affixes.dita (About Team Affixes)
- t_cover_mare.dita (Cover a Mare with a Public Covering)
  - t_register_horse_ec.dita (Register a Horse in an Equestrian Center)
  - r_breeding_bmis.dita (Reproduction Black Market Items)

This map presents a cohesive set of conceptual and task topics that inform the player what a covering is and how it fits into their workflow in the game as a breeder. It addresses User Scenario 2’s specific need—in trying to figure out how to cover a mare with a public covering offer—and it provides additional information that tells the player more about coverings in general, including the different types and an extra set of topics related to team coverings. What’s also helpful about this topic model is that, for really beginner players, it contains a small section on how to board a horse in an equestrian center. This is great for players who are new to the game and may, depending on their circumstances, keep getting an error message when attempting to cover their mare prompting them to board their horse in an equestrian center first. Additionally, an extra reference topic is included in this map as well that lists the different Black Market Items that can be applied to a mare during the time of accepting the covering—this is a great resource for players who are unfamiliar with what these items do and would be interested in using them to enhance the gestation period or stats of the foals after the covering has been accepted.

## User Scenario 3: BLUP
Map Outline:
- c_about_blup.dita (About the Best Unbiased Linear Prediction (BLUP) Score)
- t_maximize_blup.dita (Maximize a Horse's Best Unbiased Linear Prediction (BLUP) Score)
  - r_top_skills_rh_breeds.dita (Top Three Skills by Riding Horse Breed)
  - r_tack_bonuses.dita (Tack Bonuses)
  - r_foal_games (Foal Games Schedule)
- t_register_horse_ec.dita (Register a Horse in an Equestrian Center)
  - r_ec_benefits.dita (Equestrian Center Benefits)

This map presents extensive information about the Best Linear Unbiased Prediction Score (BLUP) that includes what it is, why it’s relevant to breeders, what factors influence it, and how to maximize it so that players can breed the best possible foals from a set of parent horses. The specific task that covers how to maximize the score (obtain a score of 100) assumes a lot of basic knowledge about caring for horses in the game on behalf of the player reading the topics, which is appropriate for the particular user scenario it is trying to address, as the user is meant to already be at an advanced level. However, a lot of the extra information found in the reference topics could prove exceptionally useful to newer and novice players attempting to carry out this task, especially the foal games reference topic (r_foal_games), the information regarding the top three skills of each breed (r_top_skills_rh_breeds), and information that aids a player in picking the most effective equestrian center for their horse (r_register_horse_ec; r_ec_benefits).
