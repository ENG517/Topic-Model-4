<title>What is an Affix?</title>
    <conbody>An affix is similar to a brand.  It identifies a horse you bred and can only be put on your homebreds. Affixes can also be changed and edited if the horse you're altering the affix of was bred by you. You can reserve one every 30 days. When you want to give your horse the affix, you go to the profile of the horse, click the plus button next to the horses name. You can choose "edit profile" and then choose the affix you just made</conbody>
