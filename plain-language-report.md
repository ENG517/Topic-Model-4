## Document Design
When it came to design, we made sure to make choices that kept our document simple and easy to read.

### Colors
We decided that our documentation should exhibit and match the same colors that the game's user interface (UI) uses most often. This includes a combination of greens, blues, tans, and golds. We grabbed screenshots of the UI and plugged them into a hex code generator that gave us a spectrum of colors to work with.

### Fonts, Size, & Spacing
Since it seems to be a standard in the industry to use serif fonts as headings and sans-serif fonts as non-headings, Kelly and I opted to use the serif font Average as our font for headings and the sans-serif font Poppins as the regular copy font. However, the title font is Archivo Black, because we wanted something that was simultaneously simple and bold. Additionally, we took the time to comb through each font and assign appropriate sizes and spacings. Ideally, we wanted there to be a little bit of space in between regular paragraphs of text with bigger spaces in between different sections on a page. On top of this, we also managed to resize and center the caption text beneath images. It's a little bittle smaller and has been italicized so that it doesn't get in the way of reading the actual regular copy.

## Editing Work

### Macro-Level Content Organization
There were not a ton of things to edit when it comes to macro-level content organization. When we initially put together our topic model, we tried to make sure that the information that was presented in each topic flowed consistently across different files. For example, in both our c_about_coverings.dita and c_about_blup.dita files, the content follows a pattern of first introducing what the topic is and then explaining the context of why this topic is relevant or matters to the player reading about it.
