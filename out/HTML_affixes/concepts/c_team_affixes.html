    <p class="p">The team affix is automatically assigned to a foal born from horses bearing the team's affix if the foal's genetic potential is higher than the maximum threshold you have set for your sales.</p>
    <p class="p">Horses exceeding this genetic potential cannot be sold outside the team, unless they are geldings. Their affix cannot be withdrawn or replaced.</p>
